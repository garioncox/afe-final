## Financial Planning System / Budget Tracker

This project is a financial planning system. No systems I've seen has completely fit my needs, so I want to build one that does.

I want to be able to create categories and sub-categories based on transaction types (e.g. necessities as a large category, transportation costs as a sub category), then input my current balance and income + tag them.

Same with expenses- I want to tag an expense with one or more categories and one or more subcategories. (e.g. buying a soda will count as "food", but not "necessity").
