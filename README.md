# Final Project - Advanced Front End

## Financial Planning System / Budget Tracker

1. An elevator pitch of your project (something you can say in less than 1 minute)
   - This project is a financial planning system. No systems I've seen has completely fit my needs, so I want to build one that does.
   - I want to be able to create categories and sub-categories based on transaction types
     - (e.g. necessities as a large category, transportation costs as a sub category).
   - Then want input my current balance and income + tag them.
   - Same with expenses- I want to tag an expense with one or more categories and one or more subcategories.
     - (e.g. buying a soda will count as "food", but not "necessity").
2. The names of the contributors (if you are working with a partner)
   - Garion Cox
3. A rough list of features (this needs to be large enough to satisfy the "scope" requirements)
   - Pages:
     1. Dashboard - for viewing quick stats
     2. Settings - for turning on and off features, maybe even changing theme
     3. User Profile - to change credentials, profile picture, email, etc.
     4. Recurring Transactions - set up Bills or income to be auto populated after a date
     5. Reports - a more in depth stats page
     6. Transaction history + management page - to see, add, delete, update transactions
     7. Income tracker
     8. Budget setup page - create tags and subtags here
     9. Alert page - set up email alerts (?)
     10. Cash flow analysis page - show trends
4. A list of new things you will need to do to accomplish your project
   - Local storage - for storing transactions + budgets
   - Client side state stores - for storing a cache of data from an API
   - Toasts
   - Error Handling - for if the API is down or an unhandled error occurs
   - Network Calls - to a server API. Fetching user data, posting new tasks, etc.
   - Typescript
   - CI / CD pipeline - automatic testing + linting + deploy to k8s
   - Authentication and Authorization - must authorize before viewing user's data
   - Reusable form input components - text input, select input, date component
   - Reusable layout components - modal wrapper, generic card for data, table
