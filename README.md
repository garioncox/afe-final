# Final Project - Advanced Front End
## Financial Planning System / Budget Tracker


This project is a financial planning system. No systems I've seen has completely fit my needs, so I want to build one that does. 

I want to be able to create categories and sub-categories based on transaction types (e.g. necessities as a large category, transportation costs as a sub category), then input my current balance and income + tag them.

Same with expenses- I want to tag an expense with one or more categories and one or more subcategories. (e.g. buying a soda will count as "food", but not "necessity").

**[I will be working on this by myself]**

#

The site will have these pages:
1) Landing - for users not logged in
2) Dashboard - for viewing quick stats
3) Transaction Input
4) Transaction History / Management - to quickly see, add, delete, update all transactions
5) Budget Setup / Management - create tags and subtags here
6) Recurring Transactions Setup / Management - set up Bills or income to be auto populated after a date
7) Reports - a more in depth stats page
8) Alert Setup Page - set up email alerts
9) Settings - for turning on and off features, maybe even changing theme
10) User Profile - to change credentials, profile picture, email, etc.
